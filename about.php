    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently working as an IT assistant at Janus Advisor. I have held this position since March 2022. Working with Janus Advisor has allowed me to develop and enhance my skills and experiences in the field of IT. I am passionate about this field and am always looking for ways to help the company to the best of my abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I attended Chico State University, where I studied computer science and game development for three years. However, due to financial issues, I was unable to complete my degree and had to pursue more affordable options. I transferred to Grand Canyon University, where I studied Information Technologies with an emphasis on Cyber Security, which was more aligned with my skills and passions. While studying at GCU, I was introduced into the Navy but was medically discharged due to a genetic disorder that disqualified me from continuing the Nuclear Engineering Program after three months of training.

    <p>
      When faced with a large number of tasks or projects, I break them down into smaller components, prioritize them by time needed to complete, and tackle them one by one. I prioritize quality and efficiency in my work, ensuring that every moment spent on a task is done in a professional manner and with the highest quality possible. Through trial and error and continuous learning, I strive to improve my understanding of the field of IT.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy playing video games with friends and family or working on building a strong educational foundation, such as creating tools like this portfolio. I am always looking for ways to improve myself and my work and am willing to learn new things alongside others. I am also passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am excited to continue working on projects both in my job and in my personal life. I look forward to using my knowledge and education to make a positive impact on the lives of others.

    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <p>
      Janus Advisor
      <ul>
        <li>
        Critical Network Failure - In response to a major network failure and the unexpected hospitalization of our IT lead, I assumed a critical role in ensuring business continuity. Despite the challenges of being unfamiliar with the company's network infrastructure and encountering password-protected systems, I leveraged my technical expertise, diagnosed, and resolved the issue. My actions enabled the company to maintain operations with minimal disruption.
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Left Coast Scanning
      <ul>
        <li>
          Autonomous Upload System for Many Large Files - I developed an automated system to streamline the process of uploading documents to the company's database. The system dramatically reduced the time required for this task by 99% and increased the accuracy of uploads by 99%. The system was successfully integrated into our workflow and remains in use today. Prior to implementation, the upload process required anywhere from 2 to 12 hours to complete, depending on the number and size of documents, and had a high likelihood of failure when multiple files were uploaded simultaneously. The new system is fully autonomous, and can efficiently complete the same task while also identifying and retrying failed uploads. Additionally, the system sends notification emails to relevant personnel upon completion or in the event of critical failures.
        </ul>
